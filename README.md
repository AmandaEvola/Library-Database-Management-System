# Library Database Management System

## Introduction

This project contains SQL script files for setting up and managing a library database. It includes separate scripts for creating the database, defining tables, inserting sample data, and performing basic queries. The database schema allows for tracking books, authors, and borrowers, enabling basic library management functionalities.

## Setup

To set up the library database on your local MySQL server, follow these steps:

1. **Install MySQL**: If you haven't already, install MySQL Community Edition from the official website: [MySQL Community Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-database.git


3. **Run SQL Scripts**: Execute the SQL script files in your MySQL client or command-line interface. Start with `create_database.sql`, followed by `create_tables.sql`, `insert_data.sql`, and `perform_queries.sql`.

## Usage

Once the library database is set up, you can use it to perform various library management tasks such as:

- Listing all books in the library
- Listing all authors
- Checking available books
- Listing books borrowed by a specific borrower
- And more!

Feel free to explore and modify the SQL queries to suit your specific requirements.
